    "text": "Preface\nEducation stands at the threshold of a technological revolution. Artificial Intelligence (AI), once confined to science fiction and research laboratories, is now reshaping how we learn, teach, and think about knowledge itself. This book explores the transformative potential of AI in education, examining both its remarkable opportunities and the critical challenges that accompany this evolution.\nAs we navigate this digital transformation, we find ourselves asking fundamental questions: How will AI change the role of teachers? What does personalized learning really mean in an AI-augmented classroom? How do we ensure that technological advancement serves equity and inclusion rather than exacerbating existing divides?",
